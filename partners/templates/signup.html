The parties agree to the following:
Preamble
LPI Inc., Canada, is an institution that is not related to any manufacturer,
which works with partners around the world to establish unified standards
for continuing education in the field of free software, especially that based
on Linux.
Thus, through the LPIC program, LPI offers a standardised, multi-national
and recognised program which utilises examinations at multiple levels to
certify an individual’s Linux skills.
Open Source Certification GmbH is the master affiliate of LPI Inc., Canada,
and, as such, operates in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Poland and in Switzerland. It is especially in-
volved in certification for the Linux and open source software field. Open
Source Certification GmbH is explicitly a party to this agreement.
With the LPI CERTIFIED SOLUTION PROVIDER Program (hereafter, “LPI CSP”),
LPI Inc. and LPI CE are seeking to support partner organisations that offer
services and system solutions in the Linux and open source software field.
This agreement makes it possible for the Partner to become an LPI CERTI-
FIED SOLUTION PROVIDER and to then participate in the partner program.

Objective of the agreement
The primary objective of this agreement is the inclusion of the Partner in an
Internet portal which is available to potential customers who are seeking a
suitable service provider in the Linux and open source software field.
By intentionally promoting the Internet portal in trade journals, well-known
general newspapers and magazines, and especially at trade fairs, the Inter-
net portal, and, beyond that, system solutions from the Linux and open
source software field will achieve significant visibility for potential custom-
ers.
LPI CE makes no guarantee or warranty for the (commercial) success of this
program.
2.

3.
Internet portal and ranking
LPI CE offers various search options on its Internet portal for potential cus-
tomers, particularly by location, postal code and country. It is also possible
to search from among all partners and from among partners who offer sys-
tem solutions for small, medium and large businesses. Combined searches
are possible.
The order of the partners shown to the potential customer as a search result
is based upon a ranking established by LPI CE. This ranking is determined
by a point system. Points are awarded based on the following criteria:
- per LPIC-1-certified employee 5 points
- per LPIC-2-certified employee 5 points
- per LPIC-3-certified employee 10 points
- per active reference customer with up to 10 employees
- per active reference customer with 11 to 250 employees
5 points
10 points
- per active reference customer with more than 251 employees 15 points
- base points for the “Approved Partner Provisional” status 150 points
- base points for the “Approved Partner” status 150 points
- base points for the “Approved Gold Partner Provisional” status300 points
- base points for the “Approved Gold Partner” status
300 points
The potential customer who is using the Internet portal can then view the
contact information provided by the Partner during the registration process
as well as the Partner’s references that have been released for publication
(see sec. 5).
The Partner cannot make any claims against LPI CE regarding a specific pos-
ition in the ranking. LPI CE establishes the ranking according to the best of
its knowledge and in good faith, trusting the accuracy of the information
provided by the Partner.
In case of an incorrect ranking, the Partner has no right to claims for dam-
ages against LPI CE unless the incorrect ranking is the result of malicious in-
tent or gross negligence on the part of LPI CE or its agents.

4.
Verification of certified employees
In order to verify an LPI-certified employee, the Partner must provide the
last name, first name, e-mail address and LPI ID of that employee.
The employee in question then receives an e-mail from LPI CE in which he or
she is asked to verify that he or she is an employee of the Partner, and in
which he or she is asked to consent to be shown as an employee in the Part-
ner’s profile.
After LPI CE has verified this, the employee is then shown as active in the
Partner’s profile.
The same applies when the employee’s status changes (e.g. receipt of a
higher level of certification).
5.
Verification of the Partner’s reference customers
In order to verify a reference customer, the Partner must provide the last
name, first name, company, address, telephone number, fax number and e-
mail address of that reference customer. In addition, the partner must
provide information about the size of the reference customer’s company
(see sec. 3, para. 2). In the Partner’s interest, information about the refer-
ence technology should also be provided.
The reference customer then receives an e-mail from LPI CE in which he or
she is asked to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the Part-
ner, and in which he or she is asked to consent to be shown as a reference
customer in the Partner’s profile.
After LPI CE has verified this, the reference customer is then shown as act-
ive in the Partner’s profile.
The same applies when the reference customer’s status changes (e.g. ex-
pansion of the system, moving to the next level of the number of employees
as detailed in sec. 2).
The Partner is obligated to indemnify LPI CE against any claims raised by
reference customers arising from the information provided about him or her
in the Internet portal or in another manner based on this agreement.
6.
Attestation/LPI CE Partner inspection
The Partner attests at this time to the accuracy of the information provided,
particularly that regarding certified employees and reference customers.
The Partner is obligated — in the interests of LPI CE’s particular quality
standards — to permit LPI CE to inspect the Partner’s records occasionally

and, upon request, to provide proof that the employees who have been lis-
ted are still employed by the Partner.

7.
Annual fee and commencement of agreement
The Partner is required to pay an annual fee to LPI CE for membership in the
program. The figures below are for each location of the Partner:
as an LPI Partner 100.00 euros
as an LPI Approved Partner 375.00 euros
as an LPI Approved Partner Provisional 375.00 euros
as an LPI Approved GOLD Partner 750.00 euros
as an LPI Approved GOLD Partner Provisional 750.00 euros
This agreement takes effect beginning on the first calendar day of the
month of ___________, 20___.
The annual fee (plus any additional legal VAT) is to be paid in the legal
amount within 14 days after LPI CE has issued an invoice for it.
During the first year of the agreement, the fee is payable on a monthly pro-
rated basis. If the Partner has multiple subsidiaries in differing locations, the
fee must be paid separately for each location.
New Partners are not shown on the Internet portal until after they have paid
their first annual fee.
8.
Loss of partner level
If a partner who is an LPI Approved Partner or an LPI Approved GOLD Partner
no longer fulfils the requirements for its type of membership (such as
through the loss of certified employees), the Partner must report this to LPI
CE immediately.
The Partner will not be placed back into the next-higher level whose require-
ments are met until after a transition period of three (3) months, during
which it can fulfil the requirements once again.
Nevertheless, the Partner is obligated to pay the annual fee according to the
type of partnership that the Partner held at the beginning of the fee year.
Fees which have already been paid will not be refunded in whole or in part.

9.
Use of logos
Through this agreement, LPI Approved GOLD Partners, LPI Approved Part-
ners and LPI Partners are simultaneously entitled to use the LPI CERTIFIED
SOLUTION PROVIDER logo with the proper identification of their partner level
for services in the Linux and open source software system solutions field.
These rights that are granted are non-exclusive and non-transferable. They
apply only within Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, the Nether-
lands, Luxembourg, Poland and Switzerland.
The Partner is explicitly not accorded the right to grant sublicenses.
The terms of this agreement do not cover other uses of the logos. In particu-
lar, the logo may not be modified in any way, nor may it be used in part.
The logo may not be used in any manner that is detrimental to its owner
and may not be associated with any illegal contents.
The Partner indemnifies LPI CE against any third-party claims which arise
from a non-approved used of the logo. In this case, the Partner assumes the
costs for the required legal defence, including all court and legal fees.
10. Termination of the agreement
This agreement is concluded for an unspecified period of time.
Both parties have the right to withdraw from the agreement upon three (3)
months notice prior to the end of the calendar year, earliest to 31 December
of the current calendar year.
If there is an important reason, the partners may withdraw from this agree-
ment without observing the advance notice requirement stated above. An
important reason exists particularly upon the initiation of insolvency pro-
ceedings by one of the partners to this agreement or if initiation is rejected
due to insufficiency of assets.
An important reason exists for LPI CE specifically when the Partner is in de-
fault in payment of the annual fee or if LPI CE decides to terminate the CER-
TIFIED SOLUTION PROVIDER program.
Notices of withdrawal from this agreement must be made in writing by re-
gistered letter.
In particular, the permission to use the logo ends upon the termination of
the agreement.

11. Internet portal
LPI CE’s Internet portal is normally available 24 hours per day (hereafter,
“operating time”).
Operating times exclude periods during which data is being backed up, sys-
tem or software maintenance is being carried out, or work on the system or
on the database are being performed.
To the extent that it is required in the interest of the users, LPI CE is entitled
to perform such work during operating time. During these periods, which the
company shall endeavour to keep to a minimum, data may be temporarily
unavailable for download.
12. Improper use
LPI CE reserves the right, upon suspicion of improper use or significant
breach of contract, or suspicion that the Partner has provided false informa-
tion, to investigate such occurrences, to take appropriate measures, and, in
the case of a justified suspicion, to deactivate the customer’s profile on the
Internet portal, if appropriate, at least until such time as the Partner
provides evidence to allay the suspicion. If appropriate, LPI CE can withdraw
from the agreement without notice in the case of especially serious infringe-
ments. The said deactivation shall be lifted without delay if the Partner is
able to allay the suspicion.
Provided that the Partner is responsible for such an infringement, the Part-
ner shall compensate LPI CE for any damages that arise as a result of an in-
fringement of the obligations in the previous paragraph.
13. Offsetting, right of retention
The Partner may only offset payable charges when its counter-claims have
been established or where they are not disputed by the LPI CE.
The Partner may only exercise a right of retention when its counter-claim is
based on the same contractual relationship.

14. Rights in the event of a defect, liability
LPI CE makes no warranties or representations as to the accuracy of inform-
ation provided by the Partner or its reference customer, particularly to the
extent that they may be shown incorrectly in the Partner’s profile. LPI CE as-
sumes no liability in this regard.
LPI CE offers no guarantee that interactive procedures reach the Partner, its
employees, reference customers or potential customers in the correct form
or that the dial-up procedure via the Internet functions correctly at all times.
Furthermore, LPI CE offers no guarantee that data will be transmitted at a
specific speed.
LPI CE assumes no liability for the security of data outside its own area of
control. In addition, it offers no guarantee regarding disruptions arising as a
result of faults in the customer’s or Partner’s computer or in the communica-
tion path to the server.
In cases of ordinary negligence, LPI CE shall only be liable for the breach of
contractual obligations, and any such liability shall be limited to foreseeable
damage, at the most, however, equal to the amount of a net annual fee.
This limitation shall not apply in the event of death, personal injury or dam-
age to health. LPI CE shall not be liable for any other damage resulting from
ordinary negligence.
LPI CE’s legal representatives, vicarious agents and employees may not be
held personally liable for damage they cause as a result of ordinary negli-
gence.

changes or additions to this agreement must be made in writing to be ef-
fective. The same applies to the waiving of the requirement that changes
and additions be made in writing.
This agreement replaces all previous agreements between the parties to the
agreement. Any oral agreements which have been made are a part of this
agreement only if they are recorded in this agreement in writing.

cial purpose of the provision that was chosen, but which is invalid.
